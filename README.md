Start backend and database containers with `docker-compose up --build`. Wait for backend server to be up in ready.
Then navigate to `public/` directory and run `npx serve` to see the results on a browser. May take some time to load the first time.

Navigate to the URL given by serve on a browser to see the result!

Currently the data is automatically filled with no data and currently stored locally in the database container. Different users will be added soon.
